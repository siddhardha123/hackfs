<!-- # ðŸ’ª **Challenges Faced 

Integrating the Lighthouse SDK was a challenging task that required a lot of effort and attention to detail. Initially, I found it difficult to navigate through the documentation and understand the technicalities involved in the integration process. However, I persevered by reading the documentation multiple times and seeking help from the development team in the Discord channel.

One of the major challenges I faced was configuring the SDKs to work with our project's requirements. It took a considerable amount of time and experimentation to get everything working correctly. Moreover, there were some small but tricky technical hurdles that I encountered along the way, which required debugging and troubleshooting to resolve. -->
